Not for beginners, from a C programmer point of view without experience in OOPs these notes are done.

1. Streams:
   C++ has a standard library iostream to control input and output operations.
   istream and ostream are two types available within the library.

2. Character literals have type char whereas in C character literals have type int.

   c++:
	sizeof('a') == sizeof(char)
   result:
	True

   c:
	sizeof('a') == sizeof(char)
   result:
	False
